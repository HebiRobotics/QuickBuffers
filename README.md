# QuickBuffers - Fast Protocol Buffers without Allocations

QuickBuffers is a Java implementation of [Google's Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) that has been developed for low latency use cases in zero-allocation environments. The API follows Protobuf-Java where feasible to simplify migration.

The main highlights are

 * **Allocation-free** in steady state. All parts of the API are mutable and reusable. Nested types are allocated eagerly
 * **No reflection** use anywhere. GraalVM native-images and ProGuard obfuscation are supported out of the box
 * **Faster** encoding and decoding [speed](./benchmarks)
 * **Smaller** code size than protobuf-javalite
 * **Built-in JSON** marshalling compliant with the [Proto3 mapping](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)
 * **Improved order** for optimized [sequential memory access](https://github.com/HebiRobotics/QuickBuffers/wiki/Serialization-Order)
 * **Optional accessors** as an opt-in feature (java8)

QuickBuffers implements the [proto2 specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto) and is compatible with all java versions from 6 through 20. So far we chose not to support proto3 because of some [design decisions](#why-protobuf-v2-instead-of-the-newer-v3) that make it unusable for us, but both versions are binary compatible and can work together. QuickBuffers supports all features except for [Extensions](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#extensions) and [Services](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#services). [Maps](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#maps) are not directly supported, but can be used with this [workaround](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#backwards).

## Getting started

In order to use QuickBuffers you need to generate messages and add the corresponding runtime dependency. The runtime can be found at the Maven coordinates below.

```xml
<properties>
  <quickbuf.version>1.0.0</quickbuf.version>
</properties>
```

```XML
<dependency>
  <groupId>us.hebi.quickbuf</groupId>
  <artifactId>quickbuf-runtime</artifactId>
  <version>${quickbuf.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The message generator `protoc-gen-quickbuf` is set up as a plugin for the protocol buffers compiler `protoc`. The easiest way to generate messages is to use the [protoc-jar-maven-plugin](https://github.com/os72/protoc-jar-maven-plugin).

```xml
<!-- Downloads protoc w/ plugin and generates messages -->
<!-- Default settings expect .proto files to be in src/main/protobuf -->
<plugin>  
  <groupId>com.github.os72</groupId>
  <artifactId>protoc-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.11.4</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <phase>generate-sources</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>run</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <protocVersion>3.19.6</protocVersion>

        <outputTargets>
          <outputTarget>
            <type>quickbuf</type>
            <pluginArtifact>us.hebi.quickbuf:protoc-gen-quickbuf:${quickbuf.version}</pluginArtifact>
            <outputOptions>indent=4,java8_optional=true</outputOptions>
          </outputTarget>
        </outputTargets>

      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

The generator features several options that can be supplied as a comma-separated list. The default values are marked bold.

| Option | Value | Description |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| **indent** | **2**, 4, 8, tab | sets the indentation in generated files |
| **replace_package** | (pattern)&#124;replacement | replaces the Java package of the generated messages to avoid name collisions with messages generated by `--java_out`. |
| **input_order** | **quickbuf**, number, none | improves decoding performance when parsing messages that were serialized in a known order. `number` matches protobuf-java, and `none` disables this optimization (not recommended). |
| **store_unknown_fields** | **false**, true  | generates code to retain unknown fields that were encountered during parsing. This allows messages to be routed without losing information, even if the schema is not fully known. Unknown fields are stored in binary form and are ignored in equality checks. |
| **enforce_has_checks** | **false**, true  | throws an exception when accessing fields that were not set |                               
| **java8_optional** | **false**, true  |  creates `tryGet` methods that are short for `return if(hasField()) ? Optional.of(getField()) : Optional.absent()`. Requires a runtime with Java 8 or higher. |                               

## Manual generation

Alternatively, you can also manually execute `protoc` using the following steps

* Download the [protoc executable](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protoc/)
* Download the [protoc-gen-quickbuf](https://github.com/HebiRobotics/QuickBuffers/releases/latest) protoc plugin
  * `.zip`: a platform specific executable that needs to be on the `$PATH`
  * `.exe`: a platform specific executable that needs to be specified with `--plugin=protoc-gen-quickbuf=${pathToExe}`
  * `java`: cross platform wrapper scripts that need to be on the `$PATH` (requires a Java 8 or higher runtime)
* Run `protoc` with `--quickbuf_out=<options>:./path/to/output`

For example, 
```bash
protoc --quickbuf_out=indent=4,input_order=quickbuf:<output_directory> <proto_files>
``` 

Note that downloading the macOS binary from a browser may add a quarantine flag that prevents it from executing. The following commands can fix it

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine protoc-gen-quickbuf
sudo chmod +x protoc-gen-quickbuf
```

## Reading and writing messages

We tried to keep the public API as close to Google's `protobuf-java` as possible, so most use cases should require very few changes. The main difference is that there are no builders, and that all message contents are mutable.

Messages can be read from a `ProtoSource` and written to a `ProtoSink`. `newInstance` instantiates optimized implementations for accessing contiguous blocks of memory such as `byte[]` and `ByteBuffer`. Reads and writes do not modify the `ByteBuffer` state, so positions and limits need to be manually if needed. Additionally, there are also (non-optimized) convenience wrappers for `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, and `ByteBuffer`. The internal state can be reset with the `setInput` and `setOutput` methods.

`ProtoMessage::getSerializedSize` sets an internally cached size, so it should always be called before serialization.

```Java
// Create data
RootMessage msg = RootMessage.newInstance()
    .setPrimitiveValue(2);

// Serialize into existing byte array
byte[] buffer = new byte[msg.getSerializedSize()];
ProtoSink sink = ProtoSink.newInstance(buffer);
msg.writeTo(sink);

// Serialize to byte array using helper method
assertArrayEquals(msg.toByteArray(), buffer);

// Read from byte array into an existing message
ProtoSource source = ProtoSource.newInstance(buffer);
assertEquals(msg, RootMessage.newInstance().mergeFrom(source));
```

**Direct Source/Sink**

Depending on platform support for `sun.misc.Unsafe`, the `DirectSource` and `DirectSink` implementations allow working with off-heap memory. This is intended for reducing unnecessary memory copies when working with direct NIO buffers. Serialization-wise there is no performance benefit compared to working with heap arrays.

```Java
// Create message
SimpleMessage msg = SimpleMessage.newInstance();
msg.setRequiredField(1);

// Write to direct buffer
ByteBuffer directBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(msg.getSerializedSize());
ProtoSink directSink = ProtoSink.newDirectSink();
directSink.setOutput(directBuffer);
msg.writeTo(directSink);
directBuffer.limit(directSink.getTotalBytesWritten());

// Read from direct buffer
ProtoSource directSource = ProtoSource.newDirectSource();
directSource.setInput(directBuffer);
SimpleMessage msg2 = SimpleMessage.parseFrom(directSource);
assertEquals(msg, msg2);
```

**JSON Source/Sink**

ProtoMessages also support reading from and writing to JSON as specified in the [proto3 mapping](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).

```protobuf
// .proto definition
message JsonMessage {
  optional int32 id = 1;
  optional bytes base64_bytes= 2;
  optional string text = 3;
}
```

```Java
// Java code
JsonMessage msg = JsonMessage.newInstance()
    .setId(3)
    .addAllBase64Bytes(new byte[]{0,27,28,31,-3})
    .setText("👍 QuickBuffers \uD83D\uDC4D");
```

All messages implement a toString method that writes the contents in prettified json. Calling `System.out.println(msg)` prints:

```text
{
  "id": 3,
  "base64Bytes": "ABscH/0=",
  "text": "👍 QuickBuffers 👍"
}
```

More fine grained control is exposed via the `JsonSink` and `JsonSource` interfaces

```Java
JsonSink sink = JsonSink.newInstance()
    .setPrettyPrinting(false)
    .setWriteEnumsAsInts(false)
    .setPreserveProtoFieldNames(false);

// use ProtoMessage::writeTo or JsonSink::writeMessage to serialize the contents
msg.writeTo(sink.clear());
RepeatedByte bytes = sink.getBytes();

// use ProtoMessage::parseFrom or JsonSource::parseMessage to parse the contents
JsonMessage parsed = JsonSource.newInstance(bytes)
    .setIgnoreUnknownFields(true)
    .parseMessage(JsonMessage.getFactory());
```

Note that the json serialization has not been tested as much as the binary serialization. We have been using it in production and are not aware of any bugs, but we also added alternative GSON and Jackson based implementations for cases that require something more battle tested (e.g. obscure floating point edge cases). The alternative wrappers be found in the `quickbuf-compat` artifact.

## Building from source

The project can be built with `mvn package` using jdk 8 through jdk 20.

`mvn clean package --projects generator,runtime -am` omits building the benchmarks.

Note that the `package` goal is always required, and that `mvn clean test` is not enough to work. This limitation stems from the fact that protobuf compiler plugins get executed by `protoc` and exchange information via protobuf messages on `std::in` and `std::out`. Using `std::in` makes it comparatively easy to get the schema information, but it becomes quite difficult to setup unit tests and debug plugins during development. To enable standard tests, the `parser` module contains a tiny protoc-plugin that stores the raw request from `std::in` inside a file that can be loaded during testing and development of the actual generator plugin. This makes the `generator` module dependent on the packaged output of the `parser` module.

## Generated accessors for different types

All nested object types such as message or repeated fields have `getField()` and `getMutableField()` accessors. Both return the same internal storage object, but `getField()` should be considered read-only. Once a field is cleared, it should also no longer be modified.

### Primitive fields

All primitive values generate the same accessors and behavior as Protobuf-Java's `Builder` classes

```proto
// .proto
message SimpleMessage {
    optional int32 primitive_value = 1;
}
```

```Java
// simplified generated code
public final class SimpleMessage {
    public SimpleMessage setPrimitiveValue(int value);
    public SimpleMessage clearPrimitiveValue();
    public boolean hasPrimitiveValue();
    public int getPrimitiveValue();

    private int primitiveValue;
}
```

### Message fields

Nested message types are `final` and allocated during construction time. The recommended way to set nested message content is by accessing the internal store with `getMutableNestedMessage()`. Setting content using `setNestedMessage(NestedMessage.newInstance())` copies the data, but does not change the internal reference.

```proto
// .proto
message NestedMessage {
    optional int32 primitive_value = 1;
}
message RootMessage {
    optional NestedMessage nested_message = 1;
}
```

```Java
// simplified generated code
public final class RootMessage {
    public RootMessage setNestedMessage(NestedMessage value); // copies contents to internal message
    public RootMessage clearNestedMessage(); // clears has bit as well as the backing object
    public boolean hasNestedMessage();
    public NestedMessage getNestedMessage(); // internal message -> treat as read-only
    public NestedMessage getMutableNestedMessage(); // internal message -> may be modified until has state is cleared

    private final NestedMessage nestedMessage = NestedMessage.newInstance();
}
```

```Java
// (1) setting nested values via 'set' (does a data copy!)
msg.setNestedMessage(NestedMessage().newInstance().setPrimitiveValue(0));

// (2) modify the internal store directly (recommended)
RootMessage msg = RootMessage.newInstance();
msg.getMutableNestedMessage().setPrimitiveValue(0);
```


### String fields

`String` types are internally stored as `Utf8String` that are lazily parsed and can be set with `CharSequence`. Since Java `String` objects are immutable, there are additional access methods to allow for decoding characters into a reusable `StringBuilder` instance, as well as for using a custom `Utf8Decoder` that can implement interning.

```proto
// .proto
message SimpleMessage {
    optional string optional_string = 2;
}
```

```Java
// simplified generated code
public final class SimpleMessage {
    public SimpleMessage setOptionalString(CharSequence value);
    public SimpleMessage clearOptionalString(); // sets length = 0
    public boolean hasOptionalString();
    public String getOptionalString(); // lazily converted string
    public Utf8String getOptionalStringBytes(); // internal representation -> treat as read-only
    public Utf8String getMutableOptionalStringBytes(); // internal representation -> may be modified until has state is cleared

    private final Utf8String optionalString = Utf8String.newEmptyInstance();
}
```

```Java
// Get characters
SimpleMessage msg = SimpleMessage.newInstance().setOptionalString("my-text");

StringBuilder chars = new StringBuilder();
msg.getOptionalStringBytes().getChars(chars); // chars now contains "my-text"
```

### Repeated fields

Repeated scalar fields work mostly the same as String fields, but the internal `array()` can be accessed directly if needed. Repeated messages and object types provide a `next()` method that adds one element and provides a mutable reference to it.

```proto
// .proto
message SimpleMessage {
    repeated double repeated_double   = 42;
}
```

```Java
// simplified generated code
public final class SimpleMessage {
    public SimpleMessage addRepeatedDouble(double value); // adds one value
    public SimpleMessage addAllRepeatedDouble(double... values); // adds N values
    public SimpleMessage clearRepeatedDouble(); // sets length = 0
    public boolean hasRepeatedDouble();
    public RepeatedDouble getRepeatedDouble(); // internal store -> treat as read-only
    public RepeatedDouble getMutableRepeatedDouble(); // internal store -> may be modified 

    private final RepeatedDouble repeatedDouble = RepeatedDouble.newEmptyInstance();
}
```

## More information

### Mutability

Our main reason for creating this project was that all commonly available Protobuf implementations (Java, JavaLite, Wire) favor immutable messages, and that they can't be used without resulting in significant amounts of allocations. While this is not a problem for most applications, the GC pressure becomes an issue when working with complex nested messages at very high rates and with very low deadlines. Allocations can also become a performance bottleneck when iterating over large files with millions or more protobuf entries. QuickBuffers considers all message contents to be mutable and reusable. 

### Eager Allocation

The use cases we are targeting often care less about allocations during startup, but it is often important that there are no allocations in steady state. Thus, all object-type fields inside a message are `final` and are allocated immediately at object instantiation. This also makes it more likely that messages are allocated in a contiguous block and that the serialization can be done with a more sequential access pattern.

Unfortunately, we currently have no way of knowing an appropriate initial size for repeated fields, so they are initialized empty and may grow as needed. In the future, we may add custom options to specify a default and/or maximum size.  (`TODO`)

Be aware that this prevents the definition of cycles in the message definitions.

## Why Protobuf v2 instead of the newer v3?

Both proto2 and proto3 use the same wire format, so the messages are binary compatible and only differ in semantics. Unfortunately, several of the changes introduced in proto3 turned out to be major design flaws, and the protobuf team ended up adding several workarounds to revert to the original proto2 semantics. Google has stated that they will keep supporting both versions indefinitely, so we recommend sticking with proto2. For comparison, the main changes were

* No field presence

Field presence checks and non-zero defaults were originally removed to simplify implementing protobufs as [plain structs](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33229024/3574093) in languages without accessors. Unfortunately, not having field presence turned out to be a major design flaw (e.g. [#272](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/272), [#1606](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/1606)).

It was initially addressed by adding [slow wrapper types](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/f75fd051d68136ce366c464cea4f3074158cd141/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto) with special semantics, and more recently by adding [synthetic oneof fields](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/f75fd051d68136ce366c464cea4f3074158cd141/docs/implementing_proto3_presence.md) that add [explicit presence](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/docs/field_presence.md) as in proto2. As a result, even though proto3 was supposed to simplify 3rd party implementations, supporting the required workarounds actually makes it more complex than proto2.

* No non-zero defaults

Not having useful defaults requires field presence checks like `return hasValue ? getValue() : nan`, which was part of the reason why not having field presence turned out to be such a big issue.

* No zero values on the wire

Not sending default values was done to save space on the wire, but it further exacerbates the problem of field presence and lack of defaults. In the original design there is no way to tell whether something reported a valid value of zero or doesn't even know about the protocol field. This made proto3 absolutely unusable for many use cases (e.g. [#359](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/359#issuecomment-497746377)).

If needed, the same benefits could be achieved by adding generator flags or a method that clears the has bits of all fields that are set to their default values.

* No unknown field retention

This also turned out to be a major flaw and was reverted to proto2 behavior in [version 3.5](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#unknowns).

* Any instead of Extensions

The [Any](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/f75fd051d68136ce366c464cea4f3074158cd141/src/google/protobuf/any.proto) type is essentially a binary blob with a type identifier. It seems  simpler to implement and use than extensions, but we don't have a use case for either one and therefore can't compare.

* No required fields

This is a just formalization of what has already been recommended practice in proto2.
